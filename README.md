# Exercise Detector(Straight leg raise)

#Demo



## Overview

This project is an exercise detection application designed to help users determine if they are performing leg lift exercises correctly. The application uses a machine learning model to classify exercises as either "Correct" or "Incorrect" based on video input.



## Features

- Collect and label exercise data from video or webcam.
- Train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify exercise correctness.
- GUI interface to guide users through the process.
- Real-time exercise classification with visual feedback.



## Requirements

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- numpy==1.23.5
- opencv-python==4.5.5.64
- tensorflow==2.8.0
- keras==2.8.0
- scikit-learn==1.0.2
- Pillow==9.1.0 (if needed for image manipulation)
- tkinter (comes with Python standard library)

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
